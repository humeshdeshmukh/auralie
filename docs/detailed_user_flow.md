## üå∏ 1. PREDICT CYCLES (Cycle Forecasting Flow)

**Goal**: Predict upcoming period start, ovulation days, and fertile window based on past cycle logs.

### Flow Steps:
1. **User Login / Signup**
   - Auth via email, phone (OTP), or Google.
   - Optional anonymous mode for privacy.

2. **Onboarding Questionnaire**
   - Collect last 3 period start dates (if known)
   - Ask average cycle length (default: 28 days)
   - Ask for irregularities, contraceptive use, and known conditions (e.g., PCOS)

3. **Dashboard ‚Äî Cycle Overview**
   - Displays next predicted cycle start (e.g., "Your next period starts in 5 days")
   - Shows calendar view with:
     - Period days (red)
     - Ovulation day (orange)
     - Fertile window (pink)
   - Option to "Track Manually" if user wants to adjust dates.

4. **ML Prediction Engine**
   - **Input**: past cycle data, lifestyle inputs (stress, sleep, etc.)
   - **Model**: Temporal LSTM or regression for next-cycle estimation.
   - **Output**: Predicted start date, duration, ovulation window.
   - Accuracy improves over time with more data.

5. **Notifications & Alerts**
   - Daily reminder: "Your cycle is expected to start in 3 days."
   - Option to export as calendar (.ics) or sync with Google Calendar.

## ‚ù§ 2. TRACK SYMPTOMS (Lifestyle + Health Detection Flow)

**Goal**: Understand user's hormonal, physical, and emotional states based on inputs and optional device data.

### Flow Steps:
1. **Daily Check-in / Symptom Log**
   - Simple form: mood, pain, flow, discharge, appetite, sleep, exercise.
   - Optional: wearable data (heart rate, temperature, sleep, HRV).
   - "Quick log" button on dashboard.

2. **Lifestyle Data Collection**
   - Manual or automatic tracking via integrations (Fitbit, Google Fit, Apple Health).
   - System asks: "Did you experience cramps or fatigue today?"

3. **System Processing**
   - Data normalization ‚Üí model computes symptom patterns.
   - Detects anomalies: e.g., "You've had high cramps for 3 days."

4. **Insight Generation**
   - "Your stress levels are affecting cycle regularity."
   - "Mood patterns suggest luteal phase symptoms."

5. **Symptom Timeline**
   - Visual chart (line graph) of symptoms over time.
   - Tags symptoms by cycle phase (follicular, ovulation, luteal, menstruation).

6. **AI-Driven Advice**
   - Suggests: hydration, rest, or medical consult.
   - Generates weekly "Lifestyle Health Score."

## üåº 3. CHANCES (Fertility & Pregnancy Possibility Flow)

**Goal**: Predict chances of fertility or pregnancy based on cycles + symptoms + lifestyle.

### Flow Steps:
1. **Input Layer**
   - Uses predicted cycle data + logged symptoms (basal temp, cervical mucus, libido).
   - Optional hormonal data (if user tracks manually or via device).

2. **Fertility Engine (AI Layer)**
   - **ML Model**: Bayesian or logistic regression combining cycle + hormone + lifestyle metrics.
   - **Output**:
     - Fertile window probability (%)
     - Conception chance range (low/medium/high)
     - Irregularities (e.g., "Late ovulation detected")

3. **UI Display**
   - Dashboard shows: "You're in your fertile window ‚Äî 32% chance of conception."
   - Calendar highlights fertile days with green gradient.

4. **Education + Privacy**
   - Clear disclaimer: "Predictions are indicative, not diagnostic."
   - User control over whether this info is stored or deleted monthly.

5. **Optional**
   - Suggests related health content: "Understanding Ovulation Timing"
   - Option to share summary with doctor (PDF export).
